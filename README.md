## == Description ==

Sea SP-Community Edition is an automated Content Security Policy manger that first installs a strict Sea SP-Community Edition is an automated Content Security Policy manger. A Content Security Policy (CSP) is a browser security standard that controls what domains, subdomains, and types of resources a browser can load on a given web page. It is implemented via an HTTP header, but a CSP can also be placed on a web page using a <meta> tag. CSPs are compatible with most modern desktop and mobile browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Edge, Opera, and Safari. CSPâ€™s are used to detect and prevent certain types of attacks including form jacking and cross-site scripting, browser hijacking and ad injection, as well as unauthorized piggyback tags.

The Wordpress SeaSP Community Edition was created to help quickly document what domains your site is using, so you can categorize and filter out any unwanted domains. First SeaSP installs a strict non-blocking CSP to collect violation data. The violation data is stored in the Wordpress database as a php option within the plugin options schema.

Using the SeaSP Community Edition plugin, the violations can approved by domains and categorized by directives (CSS, fonts, images, JS, etc.). Base domains and subdomains can also be approved. The SeaSP UI helps users by explaining what each directive does, and how they can be used to create a CSP. 

Once the domain and directive settings are configured as needed, the CSP can be updated to blocking mode. Once the CSP is put into blocking mode, the site is protected from any unrecognized code. Helping you secure your site and protect your bounty. 

## == Installation ==

2. In the Admin Dashboard of WordPress click on the Plugins menu item on the left side.
3. Find SeaSP - Community Edition in the list of plugins and click activate.

## == Frequently Asked Questions ==
# = What data does SeaSP collect? =
 
SeaSP collects content security policy violations from the console 

# = Where is this data stored? =

The CSP violations themselves are not stored only the violating domains the directives they violated. Those are stored as a php object in the plugin options schema.

# = Is there a tutorial? =
A walk though of this plugin can be found [here](https://youtu.be/XdJNh6LEKJw)

# = How does the plugin collect CSP violations? =
the plugin installs a small javascript in the head of your site that defines a variable named _BTT_CSP_FREE_ERROR the violations are then collected in this variable made into a json string and send to the back end of the plugin via ajax using a nonce. These errors are then parsed for the domains and the directives they have violated. This data is then stored as a php object in a plugin option. This data never leaves your site. 

## == Screenshots ==

1. Current Violations page is where you review all the domains that have violated your CSP to add them to the policy for the given directive 
2. Directive Settings page is where you set source settings for each directive of your policy 

## == Changelog ==
 
# = 1.0 =
* Users can collect CSP violation data and approve violating domains to add them to their CSP
* All CSP terminology has been defined with tool tips 
* Users can set source settings for each of the directives of the CSP 

# = 1.1 =
* fixed a bug where we misnamed a folder and cause bootstrap and other UI files to break
* added a navigation menu to the top of the plugin for ease of use 
* after activation the plugin now directs to the landing page for more instructions 

## == Upgrade Notice ==
* This is the first iteration 

## == Usage ==

Once installed a strict non-blocking CSP is implemented on your site visit each page of your site to collect CSP violations for each of those pages.
Visit the Current Violations page of the plugin to review domains that have violated a directive in the CSP.
Review each of the domains carefully and check for misspellings of common domains like adobee.com instead of adobe.com as this is a common way hackers inject content into your site.
If you feel confident that the domain belongs on your site and it should be serving the file type stated, click the toggle to approve the domain and include it in the CSP.
If you want to allow subdomains of that domain to be able to serve that type of content, click the include subdomains toggle. 
To learn more about the directive that was violated click the blue Directive button.
After this process you might still see CSP violations regarding inline scripts, inline styles, blobs, or data.
To allow these this type of content in the community version you must navigate to the Directive Settings page, find the offending directive and toggle the appropriate option.
For convenience, each option has a tool tip explaining what it allows in your CSP.

## Third Party Libraries 
We use [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for the UI of our plugin to make the interface clean and simple.
Bootstraps license can be found [here](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/main/LICENSE)

We use [bootstrap toggle](https://www.bootstraptoggle.com/) because simple check boxes can be confusing and we wanted our CSP mangers UI to feel easy.
